# Blockchain-driven-AML-
This a project of developing anti-money laundering framework for cross border transactions in Bangladesh.
Cross-border financial transactions form the backbone of the global economy, facilitating trade, remittances, and international cooperation. Illicit activities such as money laundering and terrorist financing can increasingly exploit these transactions, posing significant risks to financial stability and national security. In addition, traditional Anti-Money Laundering (AML) systems often struggle with the issues of transparency, interoperability, and real-time oversight, especially when transactions span multiple jurisdictions. To address these challenges, this research introduces a blockchain-driven AML framework for cross-border transactions, with a case focus on Bangladesh as a representative emerging economy. The framework leverages the immutable and transparent blockchain ledger, ensuring accountability between participating banks and regulatory authorities. It uses AES encryption, SHA-256 hashing to ensure transaction integrity and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) to provide secure digital identities and signatures. The suggested method improves regulatory compliance, strengthens monitoring systems, and reduces susceptibility to manipulation by integrating the central bank, commercial banks, and foreign institutions in a safe and auditable setting. Several case studies and graphs have been included to demonstrate our system's security. Additionally, we have experimented with our project using both authentic and fraudulent transaction data to generate blocks. In summary, this work helps create safe and open cross-border financial ecosystems by offering a workable model for Bangladesh, as well as a scalable model for international anti-money laundering initiatives in both rich and developing countries.
